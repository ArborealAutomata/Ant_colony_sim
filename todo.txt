Trivial:
-----------------------------------------------------------

Move window up & left when selection of map 3.

button for spawning ants, some way of altering colony size.

-----------------------------------------------------------
Core:
-----------------------------------------------------------

Brush deselection.
- right click or left click on the button again


FoodPheromone:

NoFoodPheromone:

Collision test
- for each ant instance check if collides with any other class instance in respective container.
Spawn Sprite only on open space.

Surface edge collision: stay on screen. +/- x & y boundries.

Food picked up = destroyed.

Ant: may require re-write.

Ant: food variable, use for fitness, judge when ant returns to nest. Ant finds nest instance destroyed.

Add ant lifespan, extend when find food.

Auto spawn Nest instance @ random point within an area of the map. 50 pixels from an edge.

sprites: vectors 
- vector based movement.
- vector based sensing.

surfaces for sprites 

make flowchart of learning model.

modularized reinforment learning contrl control, probably FSM based.
- reward functionality
- assessment
- save weights etc. or reprisentation of the solution into a file 
  in the data folder, each time a new agent spawns use this as a template
  to build on.
- initially apply GA
- Q-learning

Extras:

research and implement ANNs
